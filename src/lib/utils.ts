//The code imports the ClassValue type and the clsx function from the clsx library.
//It also imports the twMerge function from the tailwind-merge library.
import { type ClassValue, clsx } from "clsx";
import { twMerge } from "tailwind-merge";

//This line defines a function called cn that takes a variable number of arguments (...inputs) of type ClassValue and returns a string.
export function cn(...inputs: ClassValue[]) {
  //Inside the cn function, the clsx function is used to merge the input class names into a single string. The twMerge function is then used to merge and deduplicate the class names according to Tailwind CSS rules.
  return twMerge(clsx(inputs));
}

//Overall, this utility function allows you to easily merge and deduplicate class names, making it easier to work with dynamic class names in your components.
